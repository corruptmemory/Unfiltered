### Intent chaining

Applications that internally chain intent functions are now
recommended to use `Pass.onPass` rather than the `orElse` method
defined on `PartialFunction`.

`Pass.onPass` is aware of the explicit `Pass` object that may be
returned by intents and it is also more efficient than `orElse` for
many chained intent functions. There are two ways to use `onPass`:

    import unfiltered.request._
    val combined1 = Pass.onPass(intent1, intent2)
    val combined2 = intent1.onPass(intent2)

These two produce the same combined intent function; the second uses
an implicit conversion imported from the package object.

### unfiltered-netty-server

In recent releases `plan` and `handler` took a by-name parameter to
support the case where new instances of Netty handlers are required
for each request. This lead to unexpected behavior for some more
common use cases, where the caller passed in a `new` handler thinking
it would be shared for all requests.

To avoid confusion, we've restored the previous parameter types to
`plan` and `handler` methods. If you need to pass in a plan "factory",
such as for a chunk aggregator, there is a new method `makePlan` that
takes a by-name parameter. The new `chunked(maxContentLength: Int)`
convenience method also [provides this behavior directly][chunked].

### ls.implicit.ly

Added ls plugin to the build and metadata to the repository, so
that Unfiltered releases are recorded at [ls/unfiltered][ls]. Also,
FYI! The ls server is [built with Unfiltered][lsuf].
