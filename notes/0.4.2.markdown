- new [unfiltered-agents][agents] module for targeting and identifying common [user agents][ua] provided by [chrislewis][clewis]

- netty modules now have an inversed dependency on one another. `netty-server` now depends on the `netty` module. This will provide more design consistency when implementing server behavior.

- added a `resources` method to the `netty-server` module's `Http` and `Https` objects. By default, this handler will pass netty MessageEvents upstream if a file can not be resolved. To return `NotFound` or `Forbidden` responses for stand-alone static resource servers, use `Http(...).resources(url, passOnFail = false)`

- `netty-server` `Http` and `Https` objects now define `local` and `anylocal` methods for binding to loopback interfaces

- Headers parsed as Dates should now be parsed using a US Locale to avoid potentional conflict when parsing dates

- `unfiltered-upload`s `StreamedFileWrapper#stream` method now returns a generic type `T` [#47][i47]
